# Differential-Amplifier
This is a project in Analog Electronics to design a Differential Amplifier with the folllowing specifications:
1. Differential Mode Gain (A<sub>DM</sub>) >= 5
2. Linear Range >= 0.2V
3. Output Swing of 2.4 V<sub>pp</sub>

## A Transient Analysis of input signal to the amplifier
- The amplifier was given an input signal of 20mV and the result was:
